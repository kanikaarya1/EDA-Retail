# EDA-Retail
# Overview
This project is part of The Sparks Foundation's Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) under the Data Science & Business Analytics tasks. The objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of a Sample Superstore to derive actionable insights and assist in identifying areas of improvement to enhance profitability.
# Dataset
The dataset contains attributes such as Ship Mode, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region, Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit. It can be accessed here.
# Tools Used
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
# Highlights and Insights
Identified a moderate positive correlation between sales and profit, indicating areas with potential for increased profitability.
Analyzed the impact of discounts on profit, revealing that while discounts can increase sales, they may not always contribute positively to profit margins.
Discovered significant variances in performance across different product categories and regions, suggesting opportunities for strategic adjustments.
# Recommendations
Evaluate and adjust discount strategies to optimize profitability.
Focus on high-margin categories and products to enhance the overall profit.
Implement region-specific sales strategies based on the analysis of regional sales performance.
# Conclusions
The EDA conducted on the Retail Sample Superstore dataset provided valuable insights into sales trends, profitability, and the effectiveness of discount strategies across various categories and regions. These findings can guide strategic business decisions to improve the Sample Superstore's performance.
